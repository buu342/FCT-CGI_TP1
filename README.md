# FCT-CGI_TP1 (Fireworks Display)
An interactive fireworks display written in WebGL. There are a lot of things that could be better improved, such as a more generic particle system so that I can completely scrap the need to pass the object types to the vertext/fragment shader, but that is an exercise for another time.<br/><br/> 

Drag the mouse to launch a mortar. Press Spacebar to toggle automatic rocket firing. Modify the large stack of constants in fireworks.js to customize the experience.
